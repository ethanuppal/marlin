Thank you for thinking about contributing! I will refine this document later, but here are some general points:

- Follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style in PR names.
- Sign all commits to your PR. Adding [DCO](https://developercertificate.org) is preferable but not required.
- Please try to match existing code style to the best of your ability.
- If in doubt about feature scope, make an issue where we can discuss!
- Do not use LLMs.

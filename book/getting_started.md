# Getting Started

## Install Rust

First, make sure you've installed a [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs), which
should install [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) for you.

## Install Verilator

The current integrations for Verilog and [Spade][spade] use a [Verilator][verilator] backend, which you need to install.
For example, on macOS:
```shell
brew install verilator
```
and on Ubuntu:
```shell
apt-get install verilator
```

Check this [list of packages](https://repology.org/project/verilator/versions) to find one for your operating system and view the [official installation instructions](https://veripool.org/guide/latest/install.html) if you need more help.

You're done! Now, it's time to [get started testing some Verilog](./verilog/quickstart.md).
